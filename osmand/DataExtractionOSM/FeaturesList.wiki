= Introduction =

Features described in that list are not intented to be understood to final user but it is desirable to have clear feature descriptions with right priority. In the code there is a class `ToDoConstants` where this list is synchronized.

== Osmand application (to do 122) ==

=== Refactoring issues ===
|| 116 || Move all messages.properties related Android application inside strings.xml to have better access with their translation ||

|| 96 || Introduce settings for MPH, imperial units ||
|| 113 || Calculate speed cameras/bumps on the road (announce about them) ||
|| 110 || Use android voice for pronounce command (could be used in future to pronounce street) (Issue) ||	
|| 111 || Investigate showing street name while driving (Issue) ||	
|| 86 || Allow to add/edit custom tags to POI objects (Issue) ||
|| 96 || Introduce settings for MPH, imperial units (Issue) ||

=== Not clear if really needed (Means golden ratio complexity/necessity) ===
|| 66 || Transport routing (show next stop, total distance, show stop get out, voice) ||
|| 85 || Enable on/off screen for bike navigation ||
|| 83 || Add monitoring service to send locations to internet ||

=== Unscheduled (complex) ===
|| 65 || Intermediate points - for better control routing, to avoid traffic jams ...(?) ||

|| 59 || Show route information (directions/time, ....). Now is shown in context menu route (about route) ||
|| 46 || Implement downloading strategy for tiles : select max zoom to download (16,15,14,...). That means you can save internet because 16 extends up to 18, 14 extends up to 16 - suitable for speed > 40 ||

|| *0.2* || *Version 0.2 (23.06.2010)* ||
|| 32 || Introduce POI predefined filters (car filter(other-fuel, transportation-car_wash, show-car) and others) ||

|| 37 || Get rid of exit button (!). Think about when notification should go & how clear resources if it is necessary. DONE : add to app settings preference (Refresh indexes) ||
|| 30 || Performance issue : introduce one place where refreshMap will be called using postMessage mechanism (delay more than > 50 ? ms) - `[done]`. Introduce cache of existing files (tiles). Possibly add all tiles to zip file (save from  defragmentation)  ||
|| 31 || Translation ||
|| 34 || Suppport navigation for calculated route (example of get route from internet is in swing app).  DONE : `MiniMap` done, Routing settings done, `RouteLayer` done, `RoutingHelper` done ||
|| 44 || Show gps status (possibly open existing gps-compass app (free) or suggest to install it - no sense to write own activity) ||
|| 36 || Add  search by postcode || 
|| 34 || Suppport navigation for calculated route (example of get route from internet is in swing app) ||
|| 8 || Enable change POI directly on map (requires OSM login) ||
|| 20 || Implement save track/route to gpx ||
|| 44 || Introduce settings presets (car/bicycle/pedestrian/default) - show different icons for car (bigger),  possibly change fonts, position ||
|| 45 || Autozoom feature (for car navigation) ||
|| 31 || Translate to other languages. See [TranslateHelp] to translate to other languages. ||

|| 14 || Show zoom level on map ||
|| 13 || Save point as favourite & introduce favourite points dialog ||
|| 29 || Show opened/closed amenities (in search poi) ||
|| 3 || Revise osmand UI. Preparing new icons (new main icon, new back location, menu icon) ||
|| 25 || POI search near to map location (show categories & type). Second cut. (implement incremental search) ||
|| 27 || Search intersection of streets ||
|| 24 || Implement `ResourceManager`, load cities/streets/buildings on Low memory (clear previous all addresses cities) ||
|| 28 || Implement transliteration search for android version ||
|| 5 || Search for city/streets/buildings ||
|| 15 || Investigate interruption of any long running operation & implement where it is needed. ProgressDialogImplementation should support setOnCancelListener or obtain CANCEL message &  throw InterruptedException in all methods (remaining, progress, startTask, ...) when call it. Otherwise thread could be stopped however it is not good method ||
|| 21 || Implement zooming tile (if tile doesn't exist local, we can zoom in previous tile) ||
|| 11 || Print out additional info speed, altitude, number of satellites ||
|| 19 || Show how map is rotated where north/south on map (do not consider compass) ||
|| 23 || Implement moving point from center to bottom (for rotating map) ||
|| 17 || Enable go to location by specifying coordinates ||
|| 9 || Configure file log & see log from file (when exception happened to see from device) ||
|| 2 || Showing compass on the map : use device compass if exists ||
|| 18 || Implement go to point ||
|| 0 || Minimize memory used for index & improve time for reading index ||
|| 12 || Show information of where are you going (the arrow on the map) ||
|| 10 || Specify auto-rotating map (bearing of your direction) ||
|| 22 || Investigate 3D tile view (how it is done in osmand). Looking not very good, because of angle of perspective (best perspective angle = 60) use  	android.graphics.Camera.rotateX(60), getMatrix(m), canvas.concat(m) (find example in internet). Problems : to calculate how to drag point on map, to calculate how many tiles are needed, is location visible .... ||
|| 1 || POI search near to map location (show categories & type). First cut. (implement incremental search) ||

== Swing application done ==
|| 1 || Not implemented as not important - download tiles without using dir tiles ||
|| 13 || Accept pdf files for map creation ||
|| 12 || Reinvent UI of swing app (remove Region object and clear other MapObject) use indexes to show results ||
|| 9 || Fix issues with big files (such as netherlands) - save memory (!), but needs more time to do it. The main idea is that local sqlite db is created from osm xml file and after index will be done. Requires now a few memory about 100 MB ||
|| 11 || Index buildings using interpolations (from nodes) ||
|| 10 || Improve address indexing (use relations). Use relation "a6" (to accumulate streets!),  "a3" to read all cities & define boundaries for city (& define that street in city) ||
|| 2 || Internal (Simplify `MapPanel` - introduce layers for it) - add test feature routing ||
|| 3 || Implement clear progress for indexing ||
|| 7 || Implement saving bundle of tiles in specified folder ||
|| 6 || Implement renaming/deleting street/building/city ||
|| 8 || Implement basic transliteration version ||
|| 2 || Config file log & see log from file ||
|| 3 || Reinvent index mechanism (save in zip file with tile indexes, save city/town addresses separately, read partially !) ||
|| 4 || Invent different file extensions for poi.index, address.index,... ||
